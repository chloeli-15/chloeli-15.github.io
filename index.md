<h2>Hello</h2>

I'm currently the program lead and curriculum developer of [ARENA](https://www.arena.education/), a ML engineering program for upskilling people in doing technical AI safety work. I'm developing curriculums for LM evaluations in collaboration with Apollo Research. I'm also the director of [Cambridge AI Safety Hub](https://www.caish.org), where I ran educational/research programs like [CaMLAB](https://www.caish.org/camlab) and [MARS](https://www.caish.org/mars) and spend time growing the AI safety community in Cambridge.

My research interests are to build tools that increase our [control](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/kcKrE9mzEHrdqtDpE/the-case-for-ensuring-that-powerful-ais-are-controlled) over AI systems. I do independent research projects on evaluations, steering, and robustness. I have a BA Hons in neuroscience from the University of Cambridge, where I was interested in computational cognitive neuroscience and Bayesian models.
