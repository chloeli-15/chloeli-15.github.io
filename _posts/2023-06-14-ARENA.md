I was a student at the third iteration of [ARENA](https://www.arena.education/), a 
ML enginnering for AI alignment bootcamp running in London, January 2024, then spend some time as both the program organizer and a teaching assistant in CaMLAB v3 and v4, a 2-week version of ARENA run in Cambridge. 
 
Now I'm the [Program Lead](https://www.arena.education/team) for ARENA. I'm developing new ML curriculums on LM evaluations, in collaboration with Apollo Research, that will be added to the fourth iteration running this September.
