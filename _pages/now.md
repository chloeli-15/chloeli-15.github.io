### Last Update: 14th July, 2024

* I moved from Cambridge to London, and have been here since 2 weeks ago
* Currently developing new curriculums for [ARENA](https://arena.education) and planning the 4th iteration 
* Handing over [Cambridge AI Safety Hub](https://www.cambridgeaisafety.org/)
* Finally getting around to making a website now that large language models are good enough
to hold my hand through the process
